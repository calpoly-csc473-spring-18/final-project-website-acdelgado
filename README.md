I chose to implement soft shadows for my final project. I felt this gave scenes a more realistic look to them and thought it would be fun to implement.

I used the UNC slides (and your lecture on soft shadows) to implement soft shadows.

My Software Design implementation focuses mostly on my old Object interface and the classes associated with it. However, my final raytracer is based entirely off of the post-p5 code that you gave us, so my old classes are not present (though they are similar in structure).
